  <h2>Welcome to The Hamper Hub</h2>
  <p>
    The Hamper Hub began as a small family-run idea in our kitchen in 2020, during the height of the pandemic.
    We wanted to send joy to friends and family we couldn’t be near. What started as a few hand-wrapped boxes
    turned into a growing business with heart.
  </p>

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>
    To deliver thoughtful, artisan-curated hampers that celebrate life’s meaningful moments — from big milestones
    to everyday kindness.
  </p>

  <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>🎁 Hand-assembled hampers with attention to detail</li>
    <li>🌱 Eco-friendly packaging — 100% recyclable and compostable</li>
    <li>🛍️ Local artisan partnerships (we support over 25 small makers)</li>
    <li>🚚 Free next-day delivery in select cities</li>
    <li>❤️ Personalized messages and custom orders available</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Sustainability</h3>
  <p>
    We care about the planet as much as we care about gifting. All our packaging is plastic-free, and we’ve committed to
    planting a tree for every 10 hampers sold through our partnership with <strong>OneTreePlanted.org</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>How We Work</h3>
  <p>
    From the moment you place an order, our team gets to work selecting fresh, high-quality products. Each hamper is assembled
    by hand in our studio with care and love, and we include your personal message with every delivery.
  </p>

  <h3>Meet Our Founders</h3>
  <p>
    The Hamper Hub was founded by Vukosi.R — combining Emma’s love for design with Daniel’s obsession with packaging and logistics.
    Today, we’ve grown into a dedicated team of creatives, makers, and customer care heroes.
